# Horiseon Refactor 
## Description 

I was given a website and was instructed to improve the existing code. I did this by intiale assesing the code and identifying what was not properly done. In the process I noticed that there were not many Semantic html elements in places where they can be utilized. In addiiton, the heading documents were out of chronoical order. Furthermore, there were not alt attributes after many of the images. I added these alt attributes and wrote a descriptive. 


```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Functionalities

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
